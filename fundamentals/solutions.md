Solutions are containers for the components of the application. They may contain one or multiple apps, along with components such as site maps, tables, processes, web resources, choices, flows, and more.

Solutions are used to transport apps and components from one environment to another or to apply a set of customizations to existing apps.

Unmanaged solutions allow users to make changes to the Dynamics 365 or Power Platform environment directly and are not packaged or maintained as a single unit. Unmanaged solutions must be used only for testing and development purposes.
