# Multiple Development Environments

### Developing Solutions in Multiple Development Environments

Using different Development environments for one project can be useful if the whole solution consists of multiple features. The same is about multiple different projects and solutions.

Multiple development environments can improve the development process of a project:

* Changes are isolated from one work effort being checked in before it's completed.
* One developer will not affect another while making changes.
* It is easier to manage features development and merge.
